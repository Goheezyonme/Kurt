		<span>
		The wine industry in BC is facing significant challenges in the coming years due to the severe cold snaps experienced during 
		the past two winters. In response, local wineries have come together to develop strategies to tackle these issues.One of the main 
		strategies is to host more events at the wineries, such as long table dinners and weddings. While local wine will be limited at these events, 
		wineries will remain open to the public, continuing to welcome guests. My hope is that this website will simplify the process of organizing 
		these events for everyone involved. Consider it your ultimate resource for planning events in the Okanagan. Here, you'll find everything from musicians
		and caterers to food trucks, accommodations, transportation, and much more. Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions.

		<span id="kurt-para">I currently own and operate The Naramata Taxi Co., a business that has evolved over the past decade. 
		Due to the small population here, I primarily focus on offering wine tours for tourists, as well as bike and rider shuttle services.
		My background is quite diverse. In the early 1980s, I moved to Vancouver to pursue my dream of being a frontman in a band. 
		After years of performing in various bands and working as a bartender and restaurant manager, I discovered a passion for the film industry. 
		I got my start in Film and Television production as a background extra on 21 Jump Street in the late 1980s. 
		From there, I transitioned to managing background actors on set, and eventually worked as an Assistant Director for various TV shows and movies. 
		Today, my focus is on continuing to run the taxi service while also developing a new venture, Interior South Okanagan Talent. My extensive knowledge of the wine industry,
		gained through my taxi and wine tours, has inspired me to create this online platform showcasing Okanagan talent.</span>
